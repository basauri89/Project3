<h1> Project 3: General knowledge Quizz </h1>

<p>As part of the third project in the Udacity Android development course we
need to develop the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>A questionnaire with at least 5 questions</li>
  <li>Two languages at least are mandatories</li>
  <li>A toast message will be shown once you submit the answers</li>
</ul>

<p>I have decided to create a general knowledge questionnaire for this project.
First of all the code will show a screen with all the questions listed</p>
