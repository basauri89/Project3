<h1> Project 3: General knowledge Quiz </h1>

<p>As part of the third project in the Udacity Android development course we
need to develop the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>A questionnaire with at least 5 questions</li>
  <li>Two languages at least are mandatories</li>
  <li>A toast message will be shown once you submit the answers</li>
</ul>

<p>I have decided to create a general knowledge questionnaire for this project.
First of all the code will show a screen with all the questions listed <br>
I will improve the code by adding different screens and a next and previous button in order
to browse the quizz app. The app is available is spanish as well so You can play it either in English and Spanish.</p>

<h2>Multiple Screen Branch:</h2>
<p>In this branch we will develop the multipple screen functionallity</p>
<ul>
	<li>Now we have a star screen with a logo</li>
	<li>Second screen will show the quiz</li>
	<li>Final screen will show a message and a rating bar showing how many questions you
	answered correctly</li>
</ul>
